I am an Ph.D. student at HKU, mentored by Prof. [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). I obtained my master's degree from University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I was luckily to be mentored two distinguished professors at UCSD in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision - Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/). Prior to my study at UCSD, I graduated from Central South University (CSU) in Hunan, China, where I was mentored by Prof. [Ying Zhao](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhaoying). 

Research Interests
------
- **Agent Foundation Model**: Designing and developing LLM/VLM based agent foundation model capable of interpreting and executing actions across real-world, digital, and simulated environments.
- **Language Model Reasoning**: Improving the planning, reasoning, decision-making capability of VLM/LLMs . ([LLM Reasoners](https://www.llm-reasoners.net/))
- **Foundation Model Prompting**: Employing interpretable prompting to bridge the domain gap between user objectives and the outputs of foundation models. Effectively boosting the performance of foundation models on complex tasks through efficient and effective prompting. ([PromptAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427))


Research Overview
------
I am now working on computer-use agent foundation model, supervised by Prof. Tao Yu. In Prof. Zhiting Hu's group, I worked on automatic LLM prompt optimization with Zhen. Recently our paper [PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427) is accepted by [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/). I am also working on LLM Reasoning by contributing to the [LLM Reasoners](https://www.llm-reasoners.net/) library, which ensembles the most recent LLM reasoning methods and models. In Prof. Zhuowen Tu's group, we are working on how to inprove diffusion models' conceptual performance with an end-to-end loss. During my undergraduate years, I was mentored by Prof. Ying Zhao and worked on Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks and Visualization. Here is my graduate thesis: [The Research on The Interpretability Method of DeepNeural Network Based on Average Image](assets\pdf\graduate_thesis.pdf)
